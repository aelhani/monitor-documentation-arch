# Monitoring Project Progress Tracking

## Overview

This document tracks the development progress of the Monitoring project, comprising 13 components: 5 core backend services, 4 frontend applications, 2 supporting services, and 2 DevOps components for CI/CD and GKE. Each component has a normalized coefficient (weight) reflecting its contribution to the total project. Progress is updated periodically to reflect completion percentages.

**Total Progress**: 7.7% (as of April 28, 2025)

**Calculation**: Weighted Progress = Coefficient × Progress / 100. Sum all Weighted Progress values.

## Update Instructions

1. **Edit Progress**:
   - Update the `Progress (%)` column as tasks are completed (e.g., change `Core Backend: Data Collection` to 10% after initial setup).
   - Recalculate `Weighted Progress (%)` using `Coefficient × Progress / 100`.
   - Update `Total Progress` by summing `Weighted Progress` values.

2. **Add Notes**:
   - Document milestones, blockers, or next steps in the `Notes` column.
   - Example: "Deployed user-mgmt-service to Kubernetes, testing connectivity."

3. **Version Control**:
   - Commit changes to `monitor-documentation-arch` repository.
   - Update the `Changelog` section with the date and summary of changes.

4. **Validate Coefficients**:
   - Ensure coefficients sum to 1.0 (100%) to maintain accurate weighting.
   - Adjust coefficients if new components are added (e.g., new microservice).

## Next Steps

- **Develop Core Backend Services**: Start `monitor-service-data-collection` or `monitor-service-auth` to expand functionality (27.3% project weight).
- **Deploy to GKE**: Create Kubernetes YAML for `monitor-service-user-mgmt` and deploy to cluster.
- **Enhance Pipelines**: Add deployment and integration test stages to Jenkins pipelines.
