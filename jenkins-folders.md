Your proposed folder structure for Jenkins—organizing your `monitor-service-user-mgmt` and future repos into **Core Backend Services**, **Frontend Applications**, **Supporting Services**, and **Infrastructure & DevOps**—looks solid and aligns well with a growing microservices architecture. Let’s evaluate it and tweak it for your Jenkins CI/CD setup, keeping it practical for your current MVP and future expansion.

---

### Your Structure
1. **Core Backend Services** (5 repos):
   - User Management (`monitor-service-user-mgmt`), Data Collection, Processing, Visualization, Alerts.
2. **Frontend Applications** (4 repos):
   - User Dashboard, Admin Panel, Live Display, Shared Components.
3. **Supporting Services** (3 optional repos):
   - API Gateway, Notifications, Logging.
4. **Infrastructure & DevOps** (3 repos):
   - GKE management, CI/CD configs (e.g., `monitor-cicd-infra-config`).

---

### Pros
- **Logical Grouping**: Mirrors your app’s architecture—backend, frontend, support, and infra—making it intuitive.
- **Scalability**: Room for 15 repos total, covering your MVP (`user-mgmt`, `infra`) and future services.
- **Separation**: Isolates concerns (e.g., frontend vs. backend), easing team assignments or permissions later.

---

### Cons & Tweaks
- **Overkill for MVP**: You only have `monitor-service-user-mgmt` and `monitor-cicd-infra-config` now—4 folders might be excessive at this stage.
  - **Fix**: Start with 2 folders (`Core Backend Services`, `Infrastructure & DevOps`), expand later.
- **Optional Repos**: “Supporting Services” being optional might clutter Jenkins if unused.
  - **Fix**: Add it only when you create those repos.
- **Granularity**: 5 backend repos might overlap (e.g., Processing vs. Visualization).
  - **Fix**: Combine if roles blur (e.g., `monitor-service-data` for collection/processing).

---

### Adjusted Structure for Now
- **Core Backend Services**:
  - `monitor-service-user-mgmt-cicd` (your current pipeline).
- **Infrastructure & DevOps**:
  - `monitor-infra-deploy` (for `monitor-cicd-infra-config`, e.g., MongoDB YAMLs).
- **Add Later**:
  - **Frontend Applications**: When you start `monitor-frontend` (e.g., your `index.html` app).
  - **Supporting Services**: When API Gateway or Logging emerges.

### Setup in Jenkins
1. **Install Folders Plugin**:
   - `Manage Jenkins` > `Manage Plugins` > `Available` > Search “CloudBees Folders” > Install.
2. **Create Folders**:
   - `New Item` > Name: `Core-Backend-Services` > Type: `Folder` > OK.
   - `New Item` > Name: `Infra-DevOps` > Type: `Folder` > OK.
3. **Move Pipeline**:
   - Create your `monitor-user-mgmt-cicd` pipeline inside `Core-Backend-Services` (same script as before).
   - Add `monitor-infra-deploy` in `Infra-DevOps` later.

---

### Why This Works
- **Now**: Keeps it simple—2 folders for 2 repos.
- **Future**: Scales to your 15-repo vision as you build out (e.g., `Frontend-Apps/User-Dashboard`).
