### Business Logic Adapted to GRI Guidelines

The core goal is to present real-time environmental data in an organized, visually engaging way. The data will be grouped into **Domains**, each representing a category of metrics. To align with GRI guidelines, which provide a framework for reporting economic, environmental, and social impacts, we’ll focus on environmental KPIs relevant to your project. Here’s how the business logic breaks down:

1. **Domains**: Categories of data to be displayed via charts. The identified domains are:
   - **Energy Production/Consumption**: Tracks energy-related metrics (e.g., kWh produced or consumed).
   - **Water Recycling/Consumption**: Monitors water usage and recycling efforts (e.g., liters consumed or recycled).
   - **Air Quality**: Measures emissions or air quality indices (e.g., CO2 levels).
   - **Other Environmental KPIs**: Covers additional metrics like waste management or biodiversity.
   - **Global Overview**: A summary of key metrics across all domains.

2. **Charts**: Each domain will use visual charts (e.g., line charts for trends, bar charts for comparisons, pie charts for proportions) to display real-time data.

3. **Real-Time Data**: Data must update dynamically, ensuring users see the latest information without refreshing the page.

4. **GRI Guidelines Integration**: The GRI framework emphasizes standardized sustainability reporting. We’ll map domains to relevant GRI standards:
   - **Energy Production/Consumption** → GRI 302 (Energy): Metrics like energy consumption and renewable energy use.
   - **Water Recycling/Consumption** → GRI 303 (Water): Metrics like water withdrawal and recycling rates.
   - **Air Quality** → GRI 305 (Emissions): Metrics like greenhouse gas emissions or particulate matter.
   - **Other Environmental KPIs** → GRI 306 (Waste), GRI 304 (Biodiversity): Metrics like waste generated or ecological impact.
   - **Global Overview**: Aggregates key GRI-aligned KPIs for a holistic view.

5. **Security**: Access is restricted to authenticated users, requiring a login page and offering a user profile page for account management.

This structure ensures the dashboard is both functional and compliant with GRI’s environmental reporting standards.

### Suggested UI Layout

The UI should be intuitive, visually clear, and capable of handling real-time data. Below is a proposed layout for the dashboard, including the login page, main dashboard, domain pages, and user profile page.

#### 1. Login Page
- **Purpose**: Secure entry point to the dashboard.
- **Layout**:
  - A centered form with:
    - **Username Field**: Text input for the user’s ID.
    - **Password Field**: Secure input for the password.
    - **Login Button**: Submits credentials for authentication.
  - Optional features:
    - **“Forgot Password?” Link**: For password recovery (if implemented).
    - **“Create Account” Link**: For new users (if applicable).
- **Design Notes**: Simple, clean design with branding (e.g., logo) and a subtle background.

#### 2. Dashboard Home (Global Overview)
- **Purpose**: Landing page after login, providing a high-level summary.
- **Layout**:
  - **Header**: 
    - App logo, navigation toggle (if sidebar is collapsible), and a user profile dropdown (e.g., “Welcome, [Username]” with logout option).
  - **Sidebar**: 
    - Vertical menu listing domains: “Global Overview,” “Energy,” “Water,” “Air Quality,” “Other KPIs.”
    - Highlights the current page (e.g., “Global Overview” on this page).
  - **Main Content**:
    - **Summary Widgets**: Small cards showing key metrics (e.g., total energy consumed, water recycled today, CO2 emissions).
    - **Overview Chart**: A large chart (e.g., a world map or multi-metric line chart) summarizing performance across domains.
- **Design Notes**: Use color coding (e.g., green for good performance, red for alerts) and ensure responsiveness for different screens.

#### 3. Domain Pages (e.g., Energy, Water, Air Quality)
- **Purpose**: Detailed view of real-time data for a specific domain.
- **Layout**:
  - **Title**: Domain name (e.g., “Energy Production/Consumption”).
  - **Filters**: 
    - Dropdowns or sliders to select time ranges (e.g., last 24 hours, week) or specific data points (e.g., production vs. consumption).
  - **Charts Area**: 
    - Grid layout with multiple charts (e.g., line chart for energy trends, bar chart for daily comparisons).
    - Each chart includes a title, legend, and tooltips for data details.
  - **Insights Section**: Brief text summarizing key takeaways (e.g., “Energy use up 5% this week”).
- **Design Notes**: Consistent chart styles across domains, with interactive elements (e.g., hover effects).

#### 4. User Profile Page
- **Purpose**: Allows users to manage their account.
- **Layout**:
  - **Header**: Same as Dashboard Home for consistency.
  - **Sidebar**: Same navigation menu, with “User Profile” highlighted.
  - **Main Content**:
    - **Account Info**: Displays username, email, or other details (read-only unless editable).
    - **Update Form**: Fields for changing password or settings, with a “Save” button.
    - **Logout Button**: Ends the session and returns to the login page.
- **Design Notes**: Minimalist form layout, with clear feedback on updates (e.g., “Password updated successfully”).

#### 5. Real-Time Functionality
- **Implementation**: Charts update dynamically using technologies like websockets (e.g., Socket.IO) or polling from a backend API.
- **Visual Cue**: Subtle animations or a “Last Updated” timestamp to indicate live data.

### Additional Design Principles
- **Clarity**: Use clear labels, legends, and tooltips so users can quickly interpret data.
- **Consistency**: Apply a uniform color scheme and typography across all pages.
- **Responsiveness**: Ensure the layout adapts to desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.
- **Accessibility**: Include alt text for charts and support keyboard navigation.

### Summary
The User Dashboard will feature:
- A **Login Page** for secure access.
- A **Global Overview** page with summary widgets and a high-level chart.
- **Domain Pages** (Energy, Water, Air Quality, etc.) with detailed, GRI-aligned charts and filters.
- A **User Profile Page** for account management.
- Real-time data updates for all charts, organized into domains mapped to GRI standards (e.g., GRI 302 for Energy, GRI 303 for Water).
