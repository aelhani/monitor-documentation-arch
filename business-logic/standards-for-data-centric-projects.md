### Recognized Standards for Data-Centric Projects
No single standard is exclusively for environmental KPI data projects, but several widely recognized standards and frameworks apply to data-centric systems, especially those handling IoT, real-time data, and analytics. Here are the most relevant ones for your project:

1. **ISO/IEC 27001 (Information Security Management)**  
   - **What**: A standard for securing data, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
   - **Why Relevant**: Your service handles sensitive KPI data (e.g., CO2 emissions, energy use) that needs protection, especially with JWT authentication via `monitor-service-user-mgmt`.
   - **How It Applies**: Implement secure APIs (HTTPS, JWT), encrypt MongoDB data, and log access (via `monitor-service-notifications-logging`). Use GCP Secret Manager for `FIREBASE_SA` and `MONGO_URI`.
   - **Morocco Context**: Aligns with Morocco’s data protection laws (e.g., Law 09-08), enhancing investor trust.
   - **Adoption**: Globally used, including by Moroccan firms like OCP for secure data handling.

2. **ISO 50001 (Energy Management)**  
   - **What**: A standard for managing energy data, focusing on KPIs like energy consumption (GRI 302).
   - **Why Relevant**: Your Energy domain tracks kWh, aligning with Morocco’s renewable energy goals (SNDD, 52% by 2030). It guides data collection and processing for energy metrics.
   - **How It Applies**: Structure `monitor-data-collection` to collect precise energy data (e.g., kWh from IoT meters), validate accuracy, and aggregate for reporting (e.g., daily totals).
   - **Morocco Context**: Supports Morocco’s energy efficiency initiatives (e.g., AMEE programs).
   - **Adoption**: Used by Moroccan industries (e.g., manufacturing) for energy reporting.

3. **OGC SensorThings API (IoT Data Standard)**  
   - **What**: An Open Geospatial Consortium standard for IoT data collection and exchange, defining REST APIs for sensor data (e.g., MQTT, HTTP).
   - **Why Relevant**: Your service collects IoT data (or plans to), and SensorThings standardizes how devices send KPIs (e.g., CO2, water usage) to `monitor-data-collection`.
   - **How It Applies**: Design `POST /metrics` to accept SensorThings-compatible payloads (e.g., `{ "datastream": "energy", "value": 452.3, "timestamp": "2025-06-10T16:48:00Z" }`). Use MQTT for real-time IoT integration.
   - **Morocco Context**: Not widely documented in Morocco but aligns with global IoT trends.
   - **Adoption**: Used in smart city and environmental projects globally.

4. **FAIR Data Principles**  
   - **What**: Guidelines ensuring data is **Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable**, especially for scientific and environmental data.
   - **Why Relevant**: Your KPIs (e.g., GRI 305 for emissions) need to be reusable for GRI reports and interoperable with `frontend-user-dashboard` or external systems.
   - **How It Applies**: Use clear metadata in MongoDB (e.g., `deviceId`, `domain`), standardize API responses (e.g., JSON schema), and document endpoints in `README.md`.
   - **Morocco Context**: Supports Morocco’s open data initiatives (e.g., data.gov.ma).
   - **Adoption**: Common in research and environmental projects, less so in Moroccan SMEs.

5. **IEEE 2413 (IoT Architecture Framework)**  
   - **What**: A framework for designing IoT systems, covering data collection, processing, and integration.
   - **Why Relevant**: Guides `monitor-data-collection`’s IoT integration (e.g., MQTT broker, device management) and scalability in GKE.
   - **How It Applies**: Structure `iotClient.ts` to handle device connections reliably, use WebSockets for real-time UI updates, and plan for device scalability.
   - **Morocco Context**: Relevant for future IoT expansion post-investment.
   - **Adoption**: Emerging in IoT-heavy industries globally.
