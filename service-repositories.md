Below is an improved version of the `service-repositories.md` document from your `monitor-documentation-arch` repository. This update enhances clarity, consistency, and completeness while aligning with best practices for a microservices-based air quality and emissions monitoring system. I’ve incorporated feedback from our discussions, included all necessary services (backend, frontend, and supporting), and ensured the structure is beginner-friendly yet scalable for your training project.

# Service Repositories

This document outlines the GitHub repositories that make up the "Monitor" system, a web application for monitoring air quality and emissions. The system follows a microservices architecture to ensure scalability, maintainability, and separation of concerns. Each repository contains source code, Dockerfiles, and Kubernetes manifests for deployment on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).

## Core Backend Services
These services form the backbone of the monitoring system, handling data collection, processing, and user management.

| **Repo Name**                | **Purpose**                                                                 | **Details**                                                                                          |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `monitor-user-mgmt`          | Manages user authentication, roles, and profiles.                           | Built with Node.js; uses MongoDB for persistence and Firebase for auth tokens (e.g., JWT).           |
| `monitor-data-collection`    | Collects air quality and emissions data from sensors and external APIs.     | Built with Node.js; stores raw data in MongoDB (or InfluxDB for time-series optimization).           |
| `monitor-data-processing`    | Processes raw data into insights (e.g., averages, trends, anomalies).       | Built with Node.js; stores results in MongoDB; performs calculations and analytics.                 |
| `monitor-visualization`      | Generates visualizations like charts and maps for the frontend.             | Built with Node.js; uses Chart.js or similar for rendering; serves data via REST APIs.              |
| `monitor-alerts`             | Monitors data thresholds and sends notifications (e.g., email, SMS).        | Built with Node.js; integrates with notification APIs (e.g., Twilio, SendGrid).                     |

## Frontend Applications (React-Based)
These repositories provide user interfaces tailored to different audiences and use cases.

| **Repo Name**                | **Purpose**                                                                 | **Details**                                                                                          |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `monitor-dashboard`          | Main UI for users to view air quality data, reports, and alerts.            | Built with React; displays dashboards with charts and maps; connects to backend via REST APIs.       |
| `monitor-admin-panel`        | Admin interface for managing users, thresholds, and system settings.        | Built with React; provides CRUD operations for admins; integrates with `monitor-user-mgmt`.          |
| `monitor-live-display`       | Real-time, large-screen display for public viewing (auto-refreshing).       | Built with React; shows live air quality/emissions data; optimized for simplicity and visibility.    |
| `monitor-ui-components`      | Shared React components for consistency across frontends (optional).        | Contains reusable UI elements (e.g., buttons, charts); reduces duplication across frontend repos.    |

## Supporting Services (Optional Backend Utilities)
These services enhance the system’s functionality and can be added as needed.

| **Repo Name**                | **Purpose**                                                                 | **Details**                                                                                          |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `monitor-api-gateway`        | Routes API requests, handles authentication, and balances load.             | Built with Node.js (e.g., Express Gateway); acts as a single entry point for all services.           |
| `monitor-notification`       | Centralizes notification delivery (email, SMS, push).                       | Built with Node.js; consolidates alert delivery from `monitor-alerts` and other services.            |
| `monitor-logging`            | Collects logs and metrics for system health monitoring.                     | Built with Node.js; integrates with Google Cloud Logging or ELK stack for observability.             |

## Infrastructure & DevOps
These repositories manage deployment and automation for the system.

|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `monitor-infra-config`       | Stores Infrastructure as Code for GKE and related resources.                | Uses Terraform or Helm charts; defines cluster setup (e.g., `e2-small` nodes in `europe-west1-b`).   |
| `monitor-ci-cd-pipelines`    | Defines CI/CD workflows for building, testing, and deploying services.      | Uses GitHub Actions; builds Docker images, pushes to GCR, and deploys to GKE.                       |
| `monitor-helm-charts`        | Kubernetes Helm charts for deploying microservices (optional).              | Contains parameterized manifests for easy deployment of all services.                               |
