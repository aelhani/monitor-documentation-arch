Now that we have the core services, let's break them down and clarify their responsibilities. We can also outline the next steps to proceed effectively:

---

### **1. User Management Service**
   **Responsibilities**:
   - **Authentication**: Handles login, registration, and token management (likely using JWT).
   - **Authorization**: Manages roles and permissions (admin, user, etc.).
   - **User Profiles**: Stores user-specific data (personal info, preferences, etc.).
   - **Password Management**: Handles password reset, encryption, and security.
   
   **Technologies**: 
   - **Auth0**, **OAuth2.0**, **JWT** for token-based authentication.
   - Database: **MongoDB** (NoSQL) or **PostgreSQL** (SQL) for user data.

---

### **2. Sensor Data Service**
   **Responsibilities**:
   - **Data Collection**: Collects air quality, emissions, and sensor data from different sources.
   - **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and formats data for further processing.
   - **Data Storage**: Stores raw and processed sensor data in a database.
   - **Data Retrieval**: Provides APIs to query data for reporting and analysis.

   **Technologies**: 
   - **Database**: Consider time-series databases like **InfluxDB** for storing sensor data or use **PostgreSQL** with time-based tables.
   - **Messaging**: **Kafka** or **RabbitMQ** to handle real-time data ingestion.

---

### **3. Real-time Data Streaming Service**
   **Responsibilities**:
   - **Real-time Data Handling**: Receives and processes real-time sensor data streams.
   - **Data Visualization**: Pushes real-time updates to the frontend dashboard.
   - **Data Synchronization**: Ensures that real-time data is synchronized with other services (e.g., Reporting Service).

   **Technologies**:
   - **WebSockets** for real-time updates to the frontend.
   - **Kafka** or **Redis Pub/Sub** for event-driven communication.
   - **Node.js** with **Socket.io** for handling real-time web interactions.

---

### **4. Reporting and Analytics Service**
   **Responsibilities**:
   - **Data Aggregation**: Aggregates data from Sensor Data and Real-time Data services.
   - **Reports Generation**: Generates daily, weekly, or custom reports based on user input.
   - **Analytics**: Provides insights (e.g., air quality trends, emission reduction, etc.) and charts.
   - **Exporting**: Allows users to export reports (PDF, Excel, etc.).
   
   **Technologies**:
   - **Charting Libraries**: **D3.js**, **Chart.js**, or **Highcharts** for generating visual reports.
   - **Backend**: **Node.js** or **Python** (Flask/Django) for report processing.
   - **Database**: **PostgreSQL** for storing historical data.

---

### **5. Alert Service**
   **Responsibilities**:
   - **Threshold Monitoring**: Monitors sensor data against predefined thresholds (e.g., when air quality goes beyond a certain limit).
   - **Notifications**: Sends alerts via email, SMS, or push notifications when thresholds are breached.
   - **History**: Tracks alert history for auditing purposes.
   
   **Technologies**:
   - **Notification**: Use **Twilio** (SMS), **SendGrid** (email), or **Firebase Cloud Messaging** for push notifications.
   - **Monitoring**: Custom threshold logic in **Node.js** or **Python**.
   - **Database**: Store alert logs in a database like **MongoDB** or **PostgreSQL**.

---

### **6. Backoffice for Admin Actions**
   **Responsibilities**:
   - **User Management**: Allows admins to create, update, or delete users, and manage their roles and permissions.
   - **Service Configuration**: Admins can set or modify thresholds for sensor data, alerts, etc.
   - **Monitoring and Auditing**: Provides a dashboard to monitor the health of all services and review system activity (e.g., user logs, alert logs).
   - **System Settings**: Admins can configure system-wide settings, like notification preferences or integrations.

   **Technologies**:
   - **Frontend**: Admin UI could be built in **React** with **Material-UI** or **Ant Design** for ease of development.
   - **Backend**: Can be part of the **User Management Service** or a separate service, using **Node.js** or **Django** for the admin panel.
   - **Database**: Same as the **User Management Service** (MongoDB/PostgreSQL).
